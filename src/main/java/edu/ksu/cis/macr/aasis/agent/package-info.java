/**
 * Every AASIS agent can be a MAS, enabling easier configuration and implementation of complex systems.
 * In complex MAS, or systems of intelligent systems, each agent may employ three types of subagents (called persona), each equipped for a specific purpose:
 * (1) the self persona (one per local or device-based MAS), responsible for controlling and issuing assignments to the MAS agent,
 * (2) worker persona, responsible for providing local sensor data, operating control equipment, and performing computational tasks, and
 * (3) affiliated persona, authorized to interact with remote agents in complex, distributed intelligent systems.
